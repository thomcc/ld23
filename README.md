# Crashed on Minutiae Prime

My entry to the Ludum Dare 23 Jam, follow the theme of "Tiny World".

This game was made in 72 hours using ClojureScript/HTML5. It uses canvas for
rendering, and has no sound.  Feel free to browse the source, however
there are some terrible hacks in it, owing to the 72 hour time constraint.
